paragraph
 TreeBase is a system for growing collaborative, limitless knowledge bases that get better with age.

title3 When TreeBase Helps

paragraph
 TreeBase helps you build knowledge bases about <i>anything</i>. It doesn't matter how simple or complex the domain.

paragraph
 TreeBase is useful whether you are building a knowledge base by yourself or with thousands of people.

title3 Demo TreeBases

list
 - TheSolarSystem🔗github.com/treenotation/jtree/tree/master/treeBase/planets - 8 files
 - IMDBSubset🔗github.com/breck7/6k - 6,000 files

title3 How it Works

paragraph
 TreeBase stores data in plain text files using TreeNotation🔗treenotation.org. Instead of storing data in rows in a compressed binary format, you store data in regular files. So a database of planets might look like this:

code
 📁planets
  venus.planet
  mercury.planet
  earth.planet
  mars.planet
  jupiter.planet
  saturn.planet
  neptune.planet
  uranus.planet

paragraph
 Each file contains information in a schema that you specify in a Grammar file. For example, the file `mars.planet` might look like this:

code
 diameter 6794
 surfaceGravity 4
 yearsToOrbitSun 1.881
 moons 2

paragraph
 The Grammar file (TreeBase's version of "Schemas"), for this file would be this:

code
 planetNode
  root
  todo Change pattern to postfix.
  pattern \.planet$
  inScope abstractIntPropertyNode abstractFloatPropertyNode
  catchAllNodeType errorNode
 anyFirstCell
  todo remove the need for this
 errorNode
  baseNodeType errorNode
 intCell
  highlightScope constant.numeric.integer
 floatCell
  highlightScope constant.numeric.float
 keywordCell
  highlightScope keyword
 abstractIntPropertyNode
  cells intCell
  firstCellType keywordCell
  abstract
 abstractFloatPropertyNode
  cells floatCell
  firstCellType keywordCell
  abstract
 surfaceGravityNode
  extends abstractIntPropertyNode
 diameterNode
  extends abstractIntPropertyNode
 moonsNode
  extends abstractIntPropertyNode
 yearsToOrbitSunNode
  extends abstractFloatPropertyNode

paragraph
 TreeBase delegates to Git for versioning, backups, and collaboration.

title3 Do I need to use a library to use TreeBase?

paragraph
 No. You can use the TreeBase system without installing any new software on your computer. In fact, you don't even need to use a computer at all. Pen, paper, and some folders work well for small TreeBases.

title3 Can I use TreeBase with my existing SQL databases?

paragraph
 Yes. With one command you can turn any TreeBase database into a SQL database. There is no lock-in.

title3 Can I use TreeBase with my existing JSON or CSV workflows?

paragraph
 Yes. With one command you can convert any TreeBase into JSON, CSV, TSV, etc. There is no lock-in.

title3 Does TreeBase scale?

paragraph
 For collaborative knowledge bases, yes. We have been using TreeBase for over 2 years in systems with millions of lines and dozens of collaborators.

paragraph
 At the moment TreeBase works best for knowledge bases of less than 100,000 entities/files (each file can have many facts). For larger TreeBases you are likely to hit some scaling challenges. Read more on that here🔗breckyunits.com/building-a-treebase-with-6-point-5-million-files.html.

paragraph
 Our focus with TreeBase is on collaborative knowledge bases, like Wikipedia for data. You are free to experiment with using TreeBase in other domains, and if you do please let us know how you are using it, but at the moment our focus is on knowledge bases.

title3 How is this different than Wikipedia?

paragraph
 You can think of TreeBase as similar to the MediaWiki🔗www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki system that powers Wikipedia. The difference is whereas Wikipedia is focused on narratives first and semantic facts second, TreeBase is focused on semantics first and narratives second.
